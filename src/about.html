    <p>My full legal name is Belina Ngoc Hong Phuc Vu. That is a very long name you might say. I will tell you the backstory behind it. On the day I was born my dad wanted my middle name to be a family heritage thing. Which would be "Ngoc". Unfortunately there would be an obstacle in the way my mom (scary) she wanted my middle name to be my Vietnamese name "Hong Phuc". Since my dad didn't want to argue he wrote both names down. That is the story of how I ended up with 3 middle names. Other than that I have 3 siblings 2 girls and 1 boy. 2 older and 1 younger. I also enjoy playing tennis, piano, skiing (I know that skiing doesn't make sense in the sentence right now but shhh), etc.</p>
