    <p>My time in Summer Bridge was definitely very interesting especially in WEB 1400. At first I didn't really see myself as a coder because I struggled terribly in my APCS class. I despised that class, if you're wondering what score I got it was a 2... Yeah it was not a great score I can say. That class was genuinely a huge regret for me, I should've come prepared with prior knowledge of coding. I definitely am not the type of person to code or to be good at coding in the first place. Coding was such a daunting task, dragging the minecraft blocks that I had no clue about just added weights on my shoulders until I finished the AP exam. Infact, I didn't even know how to traditionally code by typing up the code, I only knew how to use blocks. That is so baffling to me now that I know how to code for real now. But now this class has been a lifesaver and coding finally seemed like a doable task instead of something to dread.</p>

    <p>Some things I learned were coding in HTML, python, CSS, etc. Some more personal things I learned were teamwork, paying attention in class, etc. While I could tell you all about the cool coding I learned I would like to tell you about some of the more personal things I learned. During Summer Bridge it was a sunny day, and during class a professor separated from my friends and I to do a really hard coding task I legitimately did not know. Like I said earlier I am definitely not a person who finds coding interesting. However, during the activity I learned that not everyone has a secret hatred for you and some people actually want to genuinely be friends. I also learned to pay attention during class. While I haven't perfected my strategy I learned that even during 2 hours of a lecture every single second is important. No one said it was easy to pay attention especially in a coding class but you should atleast try. During my learning experience I also enjoyed many things during the program. I enjoyed being with my friends, finally being able to debug my code all by myself, and being able to make pretty websites with aesthetic color schemes. Those all seem pretty self-explanatory so, a little bit of lack of knowledge I feel like I didn't quite learn during this course was definitely the advanced CSS, and the Class/Id topics. I feel like those topics were rushed for me and that I didn't fully grasp how to use them. I probably didn't learn because of my absences or I just wasn't paying attention, but I feel like those were the only topics I lacked knowledge from.</p>
